## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   # iOS
   npm run ios
   
   # Android
   npm run android
   ```

## API Endpoints

The app currently uses mock data, but is designed to work with:
- `GET /products` - Fetch available products
- `POST /payments` - Process payment transactions

## Currency Support

The app supports three currencies with mock exchange rates:
- EUR (Euro) - Base currency
- USD (US Dollar)
- GBP (British Pound)

Exchange rates are hardcoded for demo purposes but can be easily replaced with real API calls.
