## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/     # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/       # App screens
â”œâ”€â”€ services/      # API and business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ types/         # TypeScript type definitions
â””â”€â”€ utils/         # Utility functions
```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   # iOS
   npm run ios
   
   # Android
   npm run android
   ```

## API Endpoints

The app currently uses mock data, but is designed to work with:
- `GET /products` - Fetch available products
- `POST /payments` - Process payment transactions

## Currency Support

The app supports three currencies with mock exchange rates:
- EUR (Euro) - Base currency
- USD (US Dollar)
- GBP (British Pound)

Exchange rates are hardcoded for demo purposes but can be easily replaced with real API calls.
