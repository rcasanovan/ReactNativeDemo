# MVVM Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of refactoring the React Native app from a traditional component-based architecture to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern using MobX for state management.

## Architecture Components

### âœ… Models (Data Layer)
- **Product.ts** - Product data model with business logic
- **Cart.ts** - Shopping cart model with inventory management
- **CartItem.ts** - Individual cart item model

### âœ… ViewModels (Business Logic Layer)
- **ProductSelectionViewModel.ts** - Manages product listing, filtering, and cart operations
- **PaymentViewModel.ts** - Manages payment processing, form validation, and payment flow

### âœ… Views (UI Layer)
- **ProductSelectionView.tsx** - Product listing and selection interface
- **PaymentView.tsx** - Payment processing interface with original design

### âœ… Store (State Management)
- **AppStore.ts** - Centralized state management
- **AppContext.tsx** - React context for store access

## Completed Refactoring

### âœ… ProductSelectionScreen â†’ ProductSelectionView
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Changes**: 
  - Converted to functional component with `observer` wrapper
  - Integrated with `ProductSelectionViewModel`
  - Maintained all original functionality (filtering, currency conversion, cart management)
  - Fixed MobX reactivity issues with Cart model

### âœ… PaymentScreen â†’ PaymentView
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Changes**:
  - Recreated exact original design with all original features
  - Integrated with `PaymentViewModel`
  - Fixed validation method binding issues
  - Fixed formData observable initialization
  - **Fixed payment processing** - Implemented direct validation in View component and API call integration
  - Maintained all original functionality:
    - Swipeable product cards with delete functionality
    - Seat selection (row and seat dropdowns)
    - Card payment form with validation
    - Cash payment with change calculation
    - Confirmation modals with transaction information
    - API payment processing with transaction alerts
    - Dynamic total calculation when items are removed
    - Fixed CartItem MobX reactivity for quantity updates
    - Cleaned up debug code and test button from payment modal

### âœ… Component Integration
- ProductCard component updated to work with new Product model
- Modal implementation fixed for dropdown functionality
- All "+" buttons and cart functionality working correctly
- Fixed type mismatch between `types/index.ts` and Product model (inventory vs stock)
- Fixed API service mapping to return correct inventory field
- Removed PaymentScreen syntax errors that were preventing app from loading
- App now successfully loads and runs with MVVM architecture

## Key Fixes Implemented

### ðŸ”§ Cart Reactivity Fix
- **Issue**: UI not updating when cart items were added/removed
- **Solution**: Added `makeAutoObservable(this)` to Cart constructor
- **Result**: MobX now properly tracks cart state changes

### ðŸ”§ Payment Validation Fix
- **Issue**: `this.validateCardNumber is not a function` error
- **Solution**: Embedded validation logic directly in setter methods
- **Result**: All form validation works correctly

### ðŸ”§ FormData Observable Fix
- **Issue**: `Cannot set property 'cardNumber' of undefined` error
- **Solution**: Restructured PaymentViewModel to use direct observable properties instead of nested formData object
- **Result**: Form data is properly accessible and reactive

### ðŸ”§ PaymentView Property Access Fix
- **Issue**: `Cannot read property 'cashAmount' of undefined` error in PaymentView
- **Solution**: Updated PaymentView to use direct properties (viewModel.cashAmount) instead of viewModel.formData.cashAmount
- **Result**: PaymentView renders correctly without formData access errors

### ðŸ”§ Form Input Values Reset Fix
- **Issue**: Form fields were being reset and not accepting user input
- **Solution**: Removed `resetForm()` call from `initializePayment()` and fixed remaining `formData` references in `setCashAmount()`
- **Result**: Form fields now accept and preserve user input correctly

### ðŸ”§ Type Mismatch Fix
- **Issue**: API service returning `stock` but models expecting `inventory`
- **Solution**: Updated API service mapping and type definitions
- **Result**: Consistent data structure throughout the app

## Current Status

### âœ… Fully Functional MVVM Architecture
- **Models**: All business logic properly encapsulated
- **ViewModels**: Reactive state management with MobX
- **Views**: Clean UI components observing ViewModels
- **Store**: Centralized state management working correctly

### âœ… Original Design Preserved
- **ProductSelectionView**: Exact same UI and functionality as original
- **PaymentView**: Exact same design with all original features
- **User Experience**: Identical to original app

### âœ… All Features Working
- Product browsing and filtering
- Cart management (add/remove items)
- Currency conversion and display
- Payment processing (card and cash)
- Form validation
- Seat selection
- Confirmation flows

## Dependencies Added
- `mobx`: State management library
- `mobx-react-lite`: React integration for MobX

## Usage Example

```typescript
// In a View component
import { observer } from 'mobx-react-lite';
import { useAppStore } from '../contexts/AppContext';

export const MyView: React.FC = observer(() => {
  const { store } = useAppStore();
  const viewModel = store.productSelectionViewModel;

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{viewModel.total}</Text>
      <Button onPress={() => viewModel.addToCart(product)} />
    </View>
  );
});
```

## Next Steps
The MVVM refactoring is now **COMPLETE**. The app has been successfully transformed from a traditional component-based architecture to a clean MVVM pattern while preserving all original functionality and design.

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Testing**: Add unit tests for models and view models
2. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling and user feedback
3. **Performance**: Optimize re-renders and state updates
4. **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments for better code documentation
